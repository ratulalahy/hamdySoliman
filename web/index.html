                            philosophy, in order to alleviate the data-flow systems performance. (Successful simulation
                            results are published in peer reviewed conference proceedings, and work was supported by the

                            Introduce a new hybrid neural network model as an image compression engine that competes
                            with the well known state-of-the-art Wavelet technology. (Successful results are peer
                            reviewed and published in the Soft Computing journal and IEEE conference proceedings, and
                            the model is patented with the USA patent office; comparison results are also posted at:

                            Introduced a new wireless security protocol with novel encryption mechanism that exceeds the

                            byte and resilient to super-user insider attack. It is considered at the core of a peer

                            and published in the journal of Network Security and ACM/IEEE conference proceedings, and
                            four patents with the USA patent office). Funds from the New Mexico Tech Foundation office

                            utilizing newly developed efficient security and routing algorithms. A prototype WSN model
                            will be built and tested at New Mexico Tech. The investigation of the prototype WSN model is

                            Introduced dynamic genericity in imperative domain languages (Ada like languages). The
                            powerful generation of data structure is done via function calls, which guarantees the
                            generation of the most sophisticated (e.g., stack of queues of stacks of lists of ... of
                            integers/reals/complex...) at runtime. (work is published in peer reviewed conferences)

                            trying to construct a corpus that enriches the current search engines to cope with different
                            Arabic dialects in the Arabic native speaking countries. Our goal is to enhance the
                            accuracy/speed of the query search and retrieval compared to the currently used search
                            engines. Security applications would be at the top of the list. (Results are published at
